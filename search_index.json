They'll be merged back in when finished. In practice, the develop branch only has merge commits from feature branches.\n\n\n\n\nThe develop branch is always in a \"ready to test\" state. All automated tests should always be passing in this branch. You should also set up a staging server to sync with the latest develop version for testing (see automated deployments).\nThe master branch\nThe master is maintained to be in a production-ready state. While the develop branch is ready for developers and testers, the master branch is ready for users.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of a sprint, the develop branch will be merged into master. This effectively promotes the current development version into a production version. From then, automated deployments will take care of deploying it to production. This means whatever's live on production at any moment is always what's the latest on master.\n\nSee also...\n\n\n§ Automation describes how you can synchronize your staging servers with the develop branch.\n\n\n\n\nNext: Let's start working by creating a feature branch.\n\n"},"git/feature_branches.html":{"url":"git/feature_branches.html","title":"Feature branches","keywords":"","body":"Feature branches\nTo start working on anything, you first create a feature branch.

Simply create a pull request from develop into master and merge it using the GitHub website. This works when master is clean and up-to-date with the latest develop branch, and has no merge conflicts.\nMerging into a dirty master\nIf master has changes that are out-of-sync with develop, you may run into merge conflicts.

This isn't the only way to use Git. In fact, the most obvious way to use Git is how the Git manual first tells us to: push all commits to a single master branch.\nThis works for solo developers, but it breaks down once you have two or more on the team. Let's go through the problems that would come up in a single-branch model.\nProblem: changes aren't contiguous\n    X - X - O - O - X - O                  X - X - X - O - O - O\n\n    Working on a single branch             Working using feature branches\n    (interleaved)                          (contiguous)\nIf two people are working on 2 features, their commits may end up being interleaved. That is, for features X and O, the commits for either feature may not show up next to each other. This makes reviewing changes more difficult.\nProblem: changes can't be reverted\nTo revert a feature that spans multiple commits, all those commits have to be reverted individually.\n# Single-branch workflow: reverting each commit individually\ngit revert 1a84c2b9\ngit revert 9bf3cb70\ngit revert 6b9c5cb4\ngit revert 215c3820\n\nGit solves this by grouping multiple commits together into a single merge commit. This is what happens when a pull request is merged. This merge commit can then be reverted, and doing so will revert all commits that it groups together.\n# Feature branch workflow: only one commit to revert\n# (Assuming 75a6c2a0 is a merge commit)\ngit revert 75a6c2a0 -m 1\n\nProblem: reviewing is difficult\n\n\n\n\nIt becomes harder to review changes when they're not contiguous or grouped in any way. By grouping them together, you can create a GitHub pull request where your peers can browse through your changes easily.\nThe solution\nThe Git workflow described in this chapter is a logical evolution brought about by the problems above.

These tasks need to be automated so they can be repeatable and protected from human errors.\nExample\nFor websites hosted on Heroku, their platform already takes care of deploy automation for you. To update a Heroku website, you simply need to do a git push:\n# Deploy your app into Heroku's hosting platform\ngit push heroku master\n\nIn other cases, you'd have to use other tools.

It's completely separate from your production system. This lets your developers, testers, and stakeholders try the latest changes without having to touch the production system.\nSetting up a staging system\nThe most ideal staging setup is a system that's exactly like your production system: same type of server, same type of databases, but hosted separately. You can use a cheaper configuration, since less people will be using your staging.\nMost projects start with using Heroku for their staging system. It's free, it supports almost every programming language, and setting a new website up takes 2 commands (see Heroku's documentation).\nAutomating staging updates\n\n\nExample deploy script in Semaphore.\n\n\nA typical CI setup is have the following auto-deployments done:\n\nAuto deploy passing tests in branch develop to your staging server.\nAuto deploy passing tests in branch master to your production server.\n\nWhen tests pass in a given branch, an auto deploy script will simply run certain commands.\n\n\nSetting up auto deployment in Semaphore.\n -->\nSeeding a staging system\nThe data in a staging system is completely different from your production system.

Seeding generates some dummy users, articles, and whatever your project needs to get it to a state where it \"looks\" like a production system.\nTo do this, you'll make a seed script in your project invoked by a certain command.

In practice, these tests are automating parts of your workflow, and automation always makes you faster in the long run.\nF5-driven development\nLet's consider the alternative to TDD. Development in the console usually involves a REPL shell that lets you invoke some code in your project. Here's an example in a typical Rails project:\n$ bundle exec rails console\nLoading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)\n\nirb> User.new(first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Smith').full_name\n\"John Smith\"\n\nPeople often abuse REPL consoles as part of their coding process. A common anti-pattern is to use a REPL to test changes as you make them. A typical REPL workflow looks like this:\n\nMake some more changes.\nPress AltTab to switch to a terminal.\nPress Up then Enter to retry the last command.\n\nIn the case of web development, switching to a browser and hitting CtrlR or F5 to reload is also very common. Wouldn't it be easier to automate this process for you?\ntest 'Builds a full name do' do\n  user = User.new(\n    first_name: 'John',\n    last_name: 'Smith')\n\n  expect(user.full_name).to eq 'John Smith'\nend\n\nBy writing those same REPL commands as a test, you can now re-run it using ruby test/user_test.rb. In fact, you can run all the tests you've ever written!\nTests as insurance\nTests let you update code mercilessly. Have you ever been in a project that uses very old versions of 3rd-party libraries such as Rails or jQuery? These projects are too afraid to upgrade knowing it may break things.\nBy writing tests, you'll be alerted of breakages when updating your project's dependencies. Changing the jQuery version may make some tests fail. You'd know then where to fix things.\nRefactoring mercilessly\nTests aren't only for upgrading 3rd-party dependencies. Even updating one part in your project can result in breaking another part. A good refactoring process starts with writing tests. When changing code, it helps to know what it can break.\nTests as documentation\nWhile tests are no substitute for formal documentation, it can provide a quick reference for other developers. Consider this test:\ntest('OrderCalculator calculating charges', t => {\n  let order = {\n    type: 'pickup', // or 'deliver'\n    items: [\n      { product: 'Glazed donut', price: 2.99, qty: 2 },\n      { product: 'Coffee', price: 3.99, qty: 1 } ] }\n\n  let charges = OrderCalculator.getCharges(order)\n  t.deepEqual(changes, {\n    subtotal: 9.97,\n    tax: 1.19,\n    delivery: 0,\n    total: 11.16 })\n\n  t.end()\n})\n\nAnother developer would easily know at a glance what OrderCalculator does, what input it takes, and what results it yields.\n"},"coding/linting.html":{"url":"coding/linting.html","title":"Linting","keywords":"","body":"Linting\n\n\n\n\nLinters are tools that enforce source code writing style based on a set of rules.

We should be about 80% there right now.\n\nThis is the default channel for most discussions. Collaborating with stakeholders happens here. Most conversations should happen here, unless they happen to be too technical, in which case they should be in #dev.\nDeveloper channel\n\n#dev\n\nFred: Can you guys take a look at PR #283? I need a review\nVelma: Hold on, let me take a look at it.\n\nHave a channel where only developers are present, without any stakeholders. This is where everyday tech-related discussions will happen. Banter in this channel is usually not relevant to stakeholders, so it's best to leave them out so not to overwhelm them.\nTemporary channels\n\n#_facebook-campaign\n\nMarketer: We need a new landing page\nFred: We're on it. What do you need?\n\nCreate new channels for discussion threads, and archive them when you're done. This lets certain discussions happen separately from everyday chatter, keeping logs clean. It also prevents overwhelming people by leaving out those who may not be involved. A good practice is to these with an underscore, such as #_feature. \nProject tracker channel\n\n#issues\n\nGitHub: Shaggy submitted pull request #283: Homepage: fix responsive issues\nTrello: Scooby added a new card: Facebook landing pages\n\nIntegrate your project management tool (eg, Trello) and GitHub's pull requests into a channel such as #issues. Don't talk in this channel, take discussions to #general instead since conversations are hard to track among notifications.\nOther notifications\nAlso consider adding notifications for other services. This largely depends on the nature of your project. Here are some ideas:\n\n#analytics for website analytics (eg, Google Analytics)\n#support for customer support tickets (eg, Intercom)\n#code for GitHub activity\n#ding for sales notifications\n\n"},"teams/":{"url":"teams/","title":"Team management","keywords":"","body":"Team management\n\nThis article is a stub.
