It's a perfect fit for small-to-medium startup teams and consultancies. You'll learn:\n\nSetting up a team-oriented web development workflow using Git, CI, and other tools\nManaging a project timeline using milestones and sprints\nHow to manage a team of developers\n\nThis book is an introduction to many established techniques and practices. It doesn't talk about these ideas in full, but just enough to introduce you to them. As such, you won't find:\n\nTechnical details of how to use Git or how to code JavaScript\nThe different nuances of Scrum or test-driven development\n\nStandard practices\nThere are no new ideas on this book. Many the points described here are standard practices in teams across the world. All this book does is compile these practices into one book.\nBorn from real experience\nThis handbook is a culmination of lessons we've learned in working as a team in building modern web applications. It documents our practices in Proudcloud and Mashupgarage, web development consultancy companies that I'm involved with. Our practices evolved organically from the Agile software development ideas we're rooted in.\n\nNext: What's the ideal process?\n\n"},"intro/ideal_process.html":{"url":"intro/ideal_process.html","title":"An ideal process","keywords":"","body":"An ideal process\nThe processes you'll learn in this book are all made to achieve a common goal. That goal is to make web development:\n\nSustainable - A development team needs a process that it can sustain for months and years.\nFrictionless - Any barriers to getting work done should be minimized, if not removed.\nQuality-oriented - Our process tries to maximize the available talents in each team.\nResilient - Changes are inevitable and an ideal process should account for that.\n\nThese ideas are not new or unique to our team. In fact, there are established principles that share these goals. One of such is Agile development, which everything in this book is rooted on.\n\nNext: What's Agile development?\n\n"},"intro/agile.html":{"url":"intro/agile.html","title":"Agile development","keywords":"","body":"Agile development\nThe Manifesto of Agile Software Development (agilemanifesto.org) is a short list of principles written in 2001 by 17 developers to help others with their combined experience.

Let's go through the problems that would come up in a single-branch model.\nProblem: changes aren't contiguous\n    X - X - O - O - X - O                  X - X - X - O - O - O\n\n    Working on a single branch             Working using feature branches\n    (interleaved)                          (contiguous)\nIf two people are working on 2 features, their commits may end up being interleaved. That is, for features X and O, the commits for either feature may not show up next to each other. This makes reviewing changes more difficult.\nProblem: changes can't be reverted\nTo revert a feature that spans multiple commits, all those commits have to be reverted individually.\n# Single-branch workflow: reverting each commit individually\ngit revert 1a84c2b9\ngit revert 9bf3cb70\ngit revert 6b9c5cb4\ngit revert 215c3820\n\nGit solves this by grouping multiple commits together into a single merge commit. This is what happens when a pull request is merged. This merge commit can then be reverted, and doing so will revert all commits that it groups together.\n# Feature branch workflow: only one commit to revert\n# (Assuming 75a6c2a0 is a merge commit)\ngit revert 75a6c2a0 -m 1\n\nProblem: reviewing is difficult\n\n\n\n\nIt becomes harder to review changes when they're not contiguous or grouped in any way. By grouping them together, you can create a GitHub pull request where your peers can browse through your changes easily.\nThe solution\nThe Git workflow described in this chapter is a logical evolution brought about by the problems above.

These tasks need to be automated so they can be repeatable and protected from human errors.\nExample\nFor websites hosted on Heroku, their platform already takes care of deploy automation for you.

This lets your developers, testers, and stakeholders try the latest changes without having to touch the production system.\nSetting up a staging system\nThe most ideal staging setup is a system that's exactly like your production system: same type of server, same type of databases, but hosted separately. You can use a cheaper configuration, since less people will be using your staging.\nMost projects start with using Heroku for their staging system. It's free, it supports almost every programming language, and setting a new website up takes 2 commands (see Heroku's documentation).\nAutomating staging updates\n\n\nExample deploy script in Semaphore.\n\n\nA typical CI setup is have the following auto-deployments done:\n\nAuto deploy passing tests in branch develop to your staging server.\nAuto deploy passing tests in branch master to your production server.\n\nWhen tests pass in a given branch, an auto deploy script will simply run certain commands.\n\n\nSetting up auto deployment in Semaphore.\n -->\nSeeding a staging system\nThe data in a staging system is completely different from your production system.

Seeding generates some dummy users, articles, and whatever your project needs to get it to a state where it \"looks\" like a production system.\nTo do this, you'll make a seed script in your project invoked by a certain command.

This seems like a backward thought at first, since writing tests take time. In practice, these tests are automating parts of your workflow, and automation always makes you faster in the long run.\nF5-driven development\nLet's consider the alternative to TDD. Development in the console usually involves a REPL shell that lets you invoke some code in your project. Here's an example in a typical Rails project:\n$ bundle exec rails console\nLoading development environment (Rails 5.0.0.1)\n\nirb> User.new(first_name: 'John', last_name: 'Smith').full_name\n\"John Smith\"\n\nPeople often abuse REPL consoles as part of their coding process. A common anti-pattern is to use a REPL to test changes as you make them. A typical REPL workflow looks like this:\n\nMake some more changes.\nPress AltTab to switch to a terminal.\nPress Up then Enter to retry the last command.\n\nIn the case of web development, switching to a browser and hitting CtrlR or F5 to reload is also very common. Wouldn't it be easier to automate this process for you?\ntest 'Builds a full name do' do\n  user = User.new(\n    first_name: 'John',\n    last_name: 'Smith')\n\n  expect(user.full_name).to eq 'John Smith'\nend\n\nBy writing those same REPL commands as a test, you can now re-run it using ruby test/user_test.rb. In fact, you can run all the tests you've ever written!\nTests as insurance\nTests let you update code mercilessly. Have you ever been in a project that uses very old versions of 3rd-party libraries such as Rails or jQuery? These projects are too afraid to upgrade knowing it may break things.\nBy writing tests, you'll be alerted of breakages when updating your project's dependencies. Changing the jQuery version may make some tests fail. You'd know then where to fix things.\nRefactoring mercilessly\nTests aren't only for upgrading 3rd-party dependencies. Even updating one part in your project can result in breaking another part. A good refactoring process starts with writing tests. When changing code, it helps to know what it can break.\nTests as documentation\nWhile tests are no substitute for formal documentation, it can provide a quick reference for other developers. Consider this test:\ntest('OrderCalculator calculating charges', t => {\n  let order = {\n    type: 'pickup', // or 'deliver'\n    items: [\n      { product: 'Glazed donut', price: 2.99, qty: 2 },\n      { product: 'Coffee', price: 3.99, qty: 1 } ] }\n\n  let charges = OrderCalculator.getCharges(order)\n  t.deepEqual(changes, {\n    subtotal: 9.97,\n    tax: 1.19,\n    delivery: 0,\n    total: 11.16 })\n\n  t.end()\n})\n\nAnother developer would easily know at a glance what OrderCalculator does, what input it takes, and what results it yields.\n\nNext: Enforce code style guidelines through linting.\n\n"},"coding/linting.html":{"url":"coding/linting.html","title":"Linting","keywords":"","body":"Linting\n\n\n\n\nLinters are tools that enforce source code writing style based on a set of rules.

Even if it's mostly subjective, a consistent style helps maintain developer sanity and code readability.\nAutomated linting\nLinting should be part of your automated test suite. This lets you catch style violations before pull requests are merged.
