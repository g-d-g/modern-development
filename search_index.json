In fact, there are established principles that share these goals. One of such is Agile development, which everything in this book is rooted on.Next: What's Agile development?"},"intro/agile.html":{"url":"intro/agile.html","title":"Agile development","keywords":"","body":"Agile developmentThe Manifesto of Agile Software Development (agilemanifesto.org) is a short list of principles written in 2001 by 17 developers to help others with their combined experience. It has 4 core values:Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\nSelf-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming.\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\nWorking software is more useful and welcome than just presenting documents to clients in meetings.\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\nRequirements cannot be fully collected at the beginning of the software development cycle, therefore continuous customer or stakeholder involvement is very important.\nResponding to change over following a plan\nAgile methods are focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.\nDone!

Our workflow is based on these ideas:Everything you do has to be reviewed by someone else.\n\nIt should be easy to review other people's work.\n\nThere should always be a working version (develop).\n\nThere should always be a release-ready version (master).\n\nNext: Learn about the develop and master branches."},"git/main_branches.html":{"url":"git/main_branches.html","title":"Main branches","keywords":"","body":"Main branchesThere are two main branches to be maintained: master and develop.The develop branchThe develop branch is what we consider the main branch. Feature branches merge into this branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody should push commits directly into this branch. Instead, work starts by creating feature branches from develop. They'll be merged back in when finished. In practice, the develop branch only has merge commits from feature branches.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe develop branch is always in a \"ready to test\" state. All automated tests should always be passing in this branch. You should also set up a staging server to sync with the latest develop version for testing (see automated deployments).The master branchThe master is maintained to be in a production-ready state. While the develop branch is ready for developers and testers, the master branch is ready for users.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of a sprint, the develop branch will be merged into master. This effectively promotes the current development version into a production version. From then, automated deployments will take care of deploying it to production. This means whatever's live on production at any moment is always what's the latest on master.\nSee also...\n\n\n§ Automation describes how you can synchronize your staging servers with the develop branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext: Let's start working by creating a feature branch."},"git/feature_branches.html":{"url":"git/feature_branches.html","title":"Feature branches","keywords":"","body":"Feature branchesTo start working on anything, you first create a feature branch.

Nobody should directly push commits to the main branches (master and develop). Working this way brings us a lot of benefits:Your work can easily be reviewed later through pull requests.\n\nIt can be reverted later on as one branch, if need be.\n\nNext: Once you're done with your work, create a pull request."},"git/pull_requests.html":{"url":"git/pull_requests.html","title":"Pull requests","keywords":"","body":"Pull requestsGitHub's Pull Request feature is used to ask your team to merge a branch in. This is perfect for our branch-based approach of working in branches and asking your teammates to review them.Creating pull requestsCreate a pull request from your feature branch (eg, feature/login) into the main branch (ie, develop). This is usually created before, or just around the time, a feature branch is finished.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a pull requestWrite a short title for your pull request. A good format to follow is:: \nWrite a short paragraph summarizing your changes. Include these additional details as well:Screenshots.

In fact, the most obvious way to use Git is how the Git manual first tells us to: push all commits to a single master branch.This works for solo developers, but it breaks down once you have two or more on the team. Let's go through the problems that would come up in a single-branch model.Problem: changes aren't contiguous    X - X - O - O - X - O                  X - X - X - O - O - O\n\n    Working on a single branch             Working using feature branches\n    (interleaved)                          (contiguous)\nIf two people are working on 2 features, their commits may end up being interleaved. That is, for features X and O, the commits for either feature may not show up next to each other. This makes reviewing changes more difficult.Problem: changes can't be revertedTo revert a feature that spans multiple commits, all those commits have to be reverted individually.# Single-branch workflow: reverting each commit individually\ngit revert 1a84c2b9\ngit revert 9bf3cb70\ngit revert 6b9c5cb4\ngit revert 215c3820\nGit solves this by grouping multiple commits together into a single merge commit.

You can use a cheaper configuration, since less people will be using your staging.Most projects start with using Heroku for their staging system.

In practice, these tests are automating parts of your workflow, and automation always makes you faster in the long run.F5-driven developmentLet's consider the alternative to TDD. Development in the console usually involves a REPL shell that lets you invoke some code in your project.

A common anti-pattern is to use a REPL to test changes as you make them. A typical REPL workflow looks like this:Make some more changes.\n\nPress AltTab to switch to a terminal.\n\nPress Up then Enter to retry the last command.\n\nIn the case of web development, switching to a browser and hitting CtrlR or F5 to reload is also very common. Wouldn't it be easier to automate this process for you?test 'Builds a full name do' do\n  user = User.new(\n    first_name: 'John',\n    last_name: 'Smith')\n\n  expect(user.full_name).to eq 'John Smith'\nend\nBy writing those same REPL commands as a test, you can now re-run it using ruby test/user_test.rb. In fact, you can run all the tests you've ever written!Tests as insuranceTests let you update code mercilessly. Have you ever been in a project that uses very old versions of 3rd-party libraries such as Rails or jQuery? These projects are too afraid to upgrade knowing it may break things.By writing tests, you'll be alerted of breakages when updating your project's dependencies. Changing the jQuery version may make some tests fail. You'd know then where to fix things.Refactoring mercilesslyTests aren't only for upgrading 3rd-party dependencies. Even updating one part in your project can result in breaking another part. A good refactoring process starts with writing tests. When changing code, it helps to know what it can break.Tests as documentationWhile tests are no substitute for formal documentation, it can provide a quick reference for other developers. Consider this test:test('OrderCalculator calculating charges', t => {\n  let order = {\n    type: 'pickup', // or 'deliver'\n    items: [\n      { product: 'Glazed donut', price: 2.99, qty: 2 },\n      { product: 'Coffee', price: 3.99, qty: 1 } ] }\n\n  let charges = OrderCalculator.getCharges(order)\n  t.deepEqual(changes, {\n    subtotal: 9.97,\n    tax: 1.19,\n    delivery: 0,\n    total: 11.16 })\n\n  t.end()\n})\nAnother developer would easily know at a glance what OrderCalculator does, what input it takes, and what results it yields."},"coding/linting.html":{"url":"coding/linting.html","title":"Linting","keywords":"","body":"Linting\n\n\n\n\n\nLinters are tools that enforce source code writing style based on a set of rules.
